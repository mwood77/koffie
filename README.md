# koffie ☕
An open source PID for espresso machines.

### What is koffie?
>  Did you know, *koffie* is the dutch word for coffee

Koffie is an open source project which allows you (the user) to programatically set and adjust the boiler pressure of your espresso machine in real time. ☕

### Caveats
- This project was designed/developed on a pre-millenium La Pavoni Europiccola (double rocker; power switch + hi/low)
- Your implementation may be different than what's outlined here, but with some simple probing on your espresso machine you should be on your way.

# Let's get started
