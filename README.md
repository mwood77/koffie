# koffie ☕
An open source PID for espresso machines.

### What is koffie?
Koffie is an open source project which allows you (the user) to programatically set and adjust the boiler pressure of your espresso machine in real time. ☕

### Caveats
- This project was designed/developed on a pre-millenium La Pavoni Europiccola (double rocker; power switch + hi/low)
- Your implementation may be different than what's outlined here, but with some simple probing on your espresso machine you should be on your way.
