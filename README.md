# koffie ☕
An open source PID for espresso machines.

### What is koffie?
Koffie is an open source project which allows you (the user) to programatically set and adjust the boiler pressure of your espresso machine in real time. ☕

### Read First!
- This proceedure is 100% reversible
- This project was designed/developed on a pre-millenium La Pavoni Europiccola (double rocker; power switch + hi/low)
    - Your implementation may be different than what's outlined here, but with some simple probing on your espresso machine's mains voltage in (the power switch) and heating element you should be on your way.

# Let's get started

This section has been split across multiple pages to make the project easier to digest.
